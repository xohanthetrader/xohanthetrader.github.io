# On Fractal Dreams

Dreams are an experience shard by most if not all of humanity. Their purpose is generally said to be in order to helo us process the activities of the day and get all of our thoughts in order yet none of this explains the form of the dreams. The dreams of a person can take the most abstract and nonsensical forms. For example you could feel yourself flying through space and the next fighting off demons. How this helps you process information I have genuinally no idea and I wont try to make assertations as to ghow this happens. I merely here want to explore two odd forms of dreams mainly the fractal nature and the non euclidian geometry in which it exists.

### Fractals

First of all let us discuss what a fractal is. what comes to mind initially when thinking of the fractal is something like the [MandelBrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) or the [Sierpi≈Ñski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle). Due to these being some of the most common types of there are two factors commonly beleived to be the form of a factorial these being:
1. Being infinitely complex
1. Being self similar  

To be self similar simply means that as you simple go deeper into the shape of fractal it looks the samne as the whole. This is like as when you cute a square into 4 even parts each the parts is that same as the original whole. A fracta though only need s the first point but does not need the second. The reason the ideas of fractals where first made to capture the infinite complexities of coastlines which are not typically self similar.

After that fairly long preamble how does this relate into dreams. As far as my experiiences stretch dreams have no definite end they keep going on forever until broken by a change in your sleep cycle. Your brain contantly processes more and more details in order to keep you in the dream. If you go somwhere where nothing exist yet your brain will fill it in. If you look inide a box there will be more detail there. No matter where you look inside of your dreams there is an infinitude of detail availabbel. How does your brain store all of this information. Well it doesnt, it does something akin to lazy loading where the detail is "loaded" in only as needed. this allws truly infinite complexity

### Non Euclidean

Just as I did with Fractals i wish to briefly explain what a euclidian gemetry is though the specifics arent necessary here. the main idea is in a generall sense a euclidean geometry is a flat geometry. thoiugh the earth is a spherical geometry on our local scale it seems mostly flat and is mostly euclidian. for a more formal definition you may read the beginign of [Euclid's Elements](https://www.claymath.org/library/historical/euclid/)

One of the most important parts is that the straight line os the shortest path between two paths. Items such as portal and wormholes are not euclidean as they allow a shorter path that is not the straight line path. How does this relate to dreams. At l;east in my experience i can step through a door and find myself in a cokmpletely differnt path in my local area/world. the acrual structure of the world makes no actual sense. I can walk up the starirs of my secondary school and find myslef in the upper halway of ym primary school.  

### Conclusion

What can we conclude from all of this. Just one simple fact Dreams are wierd and make very liitle sense providing a very poor representation of the real world.
