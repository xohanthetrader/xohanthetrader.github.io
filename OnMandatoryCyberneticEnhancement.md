# On Mandatory Cybernetic Enhancement

In the past there have been many mandatory policies aimed at the improvement of humans both mentally an physically. these range form things such as vaccine, which cna be considered augmentation to the immune system, and mandatory schooling , which can be seen as a means of enhancing the mass metnal performance of people. an idea i would like to present here is mandatory or near mandatory cybernetic enhancement. The idea here is fairly self explanaaotry it would be made mandatory for a mix of physical an mental cybernetic enhancemnet

### Funding

One of the greatest barriers to a program such as this one would be the funding of such a project as it is fairly easy to see that upgrading large mounts of humanuty to cyborgs would be fairly hard. The proposition i have from a local UK perspective initially would be to reallocaten parts of the NHS and military budgets. With people having replaced much of their organic components with robotic parts the need for tradiditonal healthcare is vastly reduced. Much of the necessary basic maintanence can be folded into the robotic shell. For any damage to the form the cost to repair this should in be throry much cheaper as the robotic shell will be partially standardiswed making the repair of these forms vey simple. I feel that is is very easy to see where the lack of a need for a military would arise from where we have a nation nearly fully inhabited by robotic people.

### Neuro-Degeneration
No matter what kind of computational augmentation is done to the human brain there is one core issue which is neuro-degeneration. This decay of the human brain can be brought on by a multitude of factors including things such as Alzheimers or Parkinson's Desease. Lesser forms of nerodegenration can occur from extended use of drugs that effects mental proceses. Now though we can replace limbs this meachnaical limbs I do not beleive it correct to fully replace the mind but only to augment it(I may touch on this later). This means that the brain says essentailly purely organic yet the body is mostly mechanical. This will lead to the brain decaying much fater than than the brain. In a normal human their neuro-degenration the main factors of the desease will start to set in at the end of life. At this time the body will also have started to decay so in either aspect they will be getting closer to death and as such the full decay sets in. Due to the imbalance in the mechanised man it is very likely that they may spend a lot of their life wothout full access to their mental faculties as their bosy has fully deccayed away yet their body binds them to life. there are a few solutions to this but one that io am partial too is reversing the direction of control. Intead of the brain exerting controll over the mechanism the mechanisms should take control of the body. By passing signals from the brain augment s through the brain and back into the limbs we would have a high degree of control over the body

### Spread and Dissent

The way that this will be initialised is through simple politics. A party will be formed that has this idea as their key policy. This means that through election most of society will have accepted this fate. Many should be able to be perusded by something of a network effect. People will feel the need to upgrade in order to keep up with others. some will deny this and this must be accepted. Though this number will need to be minimised we still need some to dissent...

### Eden

As said before a minimum level of dissent is needed. In theory this should be simple to acheive. Find people who have a slight tendency to conspiracy and and use targeted advertising techniques to push them down a path of conspiracy and true fear of this process. Once the scheme has been taken international we should have enough dissenetetrs to form a small civilisation. These people are needed for this plan to succeed into the long run. By these people we have a metric against which we can measure the advanced society. If the new society develops genetic deficiencies we have a bank of genetics to pull back from. If the new poeple veers to far from what humanity is to be we have a simple means to reset

#### A note on the Body of Theseus 

Some may make the argument that by replacing the the form of man with a mechanical body and augmenting every single part the new creation is no longer a member of humannity. This argument is certainly a valid one though it is one that I disagree with. This stems frrom ideasd on what makes a human fundamentally human. Some may say that the entire form of man creates the human but i beleive man is simply the mind. The body is simply an extension of the pure human to allow it to act in the world.
